Architecture Notes

System initializes, starts all the queues, and then initializes the syncing sequence (BLOCKING)

Sends everyone the first update (BLOCKING)

Opens Server Port for communication (This throws to clients in threads)
    Everytime we get a communication, we update the arena state.
        OOOORRRR We have a timing thread that causes an update every quarter second. This could be UDP, would require more bytes .
THings that could be threaded
    Arena.updates could be threaded (this is the only place that  changes are made to arena objects, note that reading may stil require locking)

Open server port seperate thread than only checks if we need to resync again.

GUI should ahve a thread/s for communication, also TCP, perhaps part of UDP ?

System spins up GUI thread

Perhaps batch threaded updates only updating once per every tenth of a sec (complicated do only if having speed issues. )
